Include a discussion of objects and classes.</p>\n\n<h3>Four Pillars of OOP (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Define abstraction, explain its purpose in simplifying complex systems, and provide examples of how it is used in OOP.  Discuss the difference between abstract classes and interfaces (if applicable to the language being taught).</li>\n  <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Define encapsulation and its role in data protection and code maintainability. Explain the use of access modifiers (public, private, protected, etc.) to control access to class members.</li>\n  <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Explain the concept of inheritance, its benefits (code reuse, extensibility), and different types of inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical â€“ if applicable). Discuss the use of base classes and derived classes.  Include examples of inheritance and the `super()` method (or equivalent).</li>\n  <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Define polymorphism and explain its role in creating flexible and extensible code.  Discuss method overriding and method overloading (if applicable) with clear examples.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Classes and Objects: Defining and Instantiating</h3>\n<p>Explain the difference between a class (a blueprint) and an object (an instance of a class). Provide examples of defining classes and creating objects using constructors.  Illustrate the process with code examples in the chosen programming language.</p>\n\n<h3>Attributes (Data) and Methods (Behavior)</h3>\n<p>Explain the role of attributes (data members) in representing the state of an object and methods (functions) in defining its behavior.  Provide examples of how to define and use attributes and methods within a class.</p>\n\n<h3>Constructors (<code>__init__</code>)</h3>\n<p>Explain the purpose of constructors (the <code>__init__</code> method in Python, for example), how they are used to initialize object attributes, and demonstrate their usage with code examples.  Discuss the concept of constructor overloading (if applicable).</p>\n\n<h3><code>self</code> Keyword</h3>\n<p>Explain the role of the <code>self</code> keyword (or equivalent in other languages) in binding attributes and methods to an instance of a class.  Illustrate its use with code examples and explain why it's essential in OOP.</p>\n```\n"},
